**Google Hashcode, Feb 28 2019

It was my first hashcode event, our team MK-ZM (Dmitro Rybalchenko and me) got 1st place at our hub (42 Silicon Valley) and 405th at full scoreboard (https://hashcodejudge.withgoogle.com/scoreboard)

Possible improvments:
1. Sort after making slides.
2. Two pass algorithm: first one for sample and second for looking for best variation (using back tracking).
